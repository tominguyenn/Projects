# Personal Projects Repository

Welcome to my collection of personal programming projects. This repository includes a variety of C and C++ applications I've created to practice core programming concepts, problem-solving, and software design. Each project demonstrates a different aspect of my skills, from game logic to data handling.

## What's Inside

### Division Sales
A C++ program that collects and summarizes quarterly sales data for multiple divisions. It features:
- Array manipulation and user input
- Tabular data output
- Total sales calculation
- Modular function usage

### Simple Tic Tac Toe
A classic 2-player Tic Tac Toe game written in C. Highlights include:
- Console-based gameplay
- Win, draw, and quit conditions
- Board state management and validation

### Snake Game
A fully playable Snake game in a 20x20 console grid using WASD controls. Features:
- Real-time input handling
- Snake growth and fruit spawning logic
- Collision detection and game-over conditions

## Languages and Tools Used
- C / C++
- Visual Studio Code
- GCC Compiler

## Purpose
This repository showcases my learning progress in C and C++ through fun and practical projects. Each file reflects a specific area of focus, whether it be control flow, arrays, input/output handling, or game logic.
